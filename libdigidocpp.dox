\section introduction Introduction
Libdigidocpp is the C++ library for creating applications handling digital signatures, their creation and verification. The digitally signed files are created in "DigiDoc format" (with .ddoc, .bdoc or .asice file extensions), compliant to XML Advanced Electronic Signatures (XAdES), technical standard published by European Telecommunication Standards Institute (ETSI).

Additionally the libdigidocpp library can be used to read and verify the digitally timestamped containers (using .asics file extension) with a single datafile. The file included in the container is usually a file in DigiDoc format with .ddoc extension.

Development of the library can be monitored in GitHub environment: <a href="https://github.com/open-eid/libdigidocpp">https://github.com/open-eid/libdigidocpp</a>

\subsection about About DigiDoc
Libdigidocpp library forms a part of the wider DigiDoc system framework which offers a full-scale architecture for digital signature and documents, consisting of software libraries (C, C++ and Java), DigiDocService web service and end-user applications such as DigiDoc Portal and DigiDoc Client3 according to the following figure:

\image html digidoc_framework.png "DigiDoc framework"

It is easy to integrate DigiDoc components into existing applications in order to allow for creation, handling, forwarding and verification of digital signatures and support file encryption/decryption. All applications share common digitally signed file formats (current versions are BDOC 2.1 and DIGIDOC-XML 1.3).






\subsection format Format of digitally signed file
Actively used digitally signed file formats in DigiDoc system are:
- BDOC 2.1 - default format for new files in Libdigidocpp library, described in \ref BDOC "BDOC2.1:2013"; 
- DIGIDOC-XML 1.3 - see also \ref DDOC "DigiDoc format". NB! Libdigidocpp does not implement DIGIDOC-XML 1.3 support independently - it uses \ref CDigiDoc "CDigiDoc library" library as a base component (via a wrapper class) to offer support for the file format. 
- ASiC-S - timestamped container, described in \ref ASiC "The ETSI standard TS 102 918". The library implements only read-only support for the format.

DigiDoc system uses file extension .bdoc or .ddoc to distinguish digitally signed files according to the described file formats. Other historical formats that were used previously are SK-XML, DIGIDOC-XML 1.1, DIGIDOC-XML 1.2 and BDOC 1.0. 

The following chapters provides an overview of BDOC 2.1 digitally signed file format which is the preferred format for creating new signed documents in Libdigidocpp library. 



\subsubsection container BDOC container format
The ETSI standard TS 102 918 \ref ASiC "ASiC" called Associated Signature Containers (ASiC) defines format of container for encapsulation of signed files and signatures with extra information. The ETSI TS 103 174 \ref ASiC-BP "ASiC Baseline Profile" profiles in further on. The container type used in case of BDOC 2.1 documents is Associated Signature Extended form (ASiC-E).

ASiC-E container is a ZIP file consisting of the following objects:
- a file named "mimetype", containing only the following value: application/vnd.etsi.asic-e+zip  
- data files in original format.
- META-INF subdirectory, consisting of:
	- manifest.xml – a file containing list of all folders and files in the container. The list does not contain the "mimetype" file and files in META-INF subdirectory.
	- signatures*.xml – one file for each signature, ‘*’ in the file’s name denotes the sequence number of a signature (counting starts from zero). The signatures*.xml file also incorporates certificates, validity confirmation and meta-data about the signer.

When BDOC 2.1 container is signed then all files in the container are signed, except of the mimetype file and files in META-INF subdirectory. 

Original files (which were signed) along with the signature(s), validation confirmation(s) and certificates are encapsulated within the container. As a result, it is possible to verify signature validity without any additional external information – the verifier should trust the issuer of signer’s certificate and the OCSP responder’s certificate. 

\image html asic.png "BDOC 2.1 container's contents"




\subsubsection profiles BDOC signature profiles

The format of the BDOC 2.1 digitally signed file is based on ETSI TS 101 903 standard called XML Advanced Electronic Signatures (\ref XAdES "XAdES"). The XAdES standard defines formats for advanced electronic signatures that remain valid over long periods of time. The ETSI standard TS 103 171 \ref XAdES-BP "XAdES Baseline Profile" further profiles the XAdES signature by putting limitations on choices. 

BDOC 2.1 specification defines two profiles of qualified BDOC signatures: BDOC with time-mark and BDOC with time-stamp. Both of the profiles offer long-term validation possibility by incorporating the necessary validation data in the signature. Both of the profiles are compliant to XAdES LT-Level requirements.


\paragraph BDOC-TM BDOC signature with time-mark
The BDOC signature with time-mark is based XAdES-EPES signature (Explicit Policy based Electronic Signature, see \ref XAdES "XAdES"). 

In order to offer long time validation, it is necessary to obtain proof of validity of the signer’s X.509 digital certificate issued by a certificate authority (CA) at the time of signature creation. In case of BDOC with time-marks (TM profile), the proof is obtained with a single OCSP response that has a specific "nonce" field’s value (i.e. the time-mark). 

The hash of the created signature (the &lt;SignatureValue&gt; element’s contents) is sent within the OCSP request’s and received back within the response’s "nonce" field. The OCSP request’s and response’s "nonce" field is a DER-encoding of the following ASN.1 data structure:
\code{.cpp}
	TBSDocumentDigest ::= SEQUENCE {
		algorithm AlgorithmIdentifier,
		digest OCTET STRING
	}
\endcode
The element digest is a hash value of the binary value of the &lt;SignatureValue&gt; element’s contents, element algorithm determines the used hash algorithm as defined in \ref RFC5280 "RFC 5280" clause 4.1.1.2. 

\note OCSP nonce field’s value is calculated differently in case of DIGIDOC-XML 1.3 and BDOC 2.1 formats. See the specification documents of these file formats for more information.

<b>The time-mark provides proof of the following:</b>
1. The signature value existed at a certain point of time (issuance time of the OCSP confirmation) – the verifier can calculate the hash of the signature and check its conformance to the OCSP response’s "nonce" field.
2. The signer’s certificate was valid (provided that the OCSP response is positive and does indeed confirm the certificate’s validity) at a certain point of time

It is important to notice that additional time-stamps are not necessary as time of signing and time of obtaining validity information is indicated in the OCSP response (i.e. the time-mark).

<b>NB!</b> The issuance time (producedAt field’s value) of the OCSP response (the time-mark) is regarded as the time of signature creation. 

To achieve long-time validity of digital signatures, a secure log system is employed within the model. All OCSP responses and changes in certificate validity are securely logged to preserve digital signature validity even after private key compromise of CA or OCSP responder. 

\image html security.png "Security model of time-marking mechanism"


\paragraph BDOC-TS BDOC signature with time-stamp

The BDOC signature with time-stamp is based on XAdES-BES signature (Basic Electronic Signature, see \ref XAdES).

In order to offer long time validation, it is necessary to obtaining proof of validity of the signer’s X.509 digital certificate issued by a certificate authority (CA) at the time of signature creation. 

In case of BDOC with time-stamp (TS profile), the proof is provided as follows:
1. RFC3161 compliant time-stamp is obtained from a time-stamping service. The hash of the created signature (&lt;SignatureValue&gt; element block) is sent to the time-stamping server. The server’s response contains a time-stamp token with the same hash value that can later be used to validate that the time-stamp was indeed issued for the respective signature. The time-stamp token received from the server is added to the signature providing a proof from a trusted source that the signature value existed at a certain point of time.
2. RFC 6960 compliant OCSP confirmation is obtained from an OCSP service. The OCSP response received from the server is used as a trusted source to confirm that the signer’s certificate was valid at a certain point of time (producedAt field’s value in the OCSP response). 
3. The verifier must check the time-stamp token’s and OCSP confirmation’s time difference. If the difference is acceptable then it can stated that the signer’s certificate was valid at the time of signature creation.

<b>NB!</b> The issuance time (getTime field’s value) of the time-stamp token (received with the response from time-stamping server) is regarded as the time of signature creation. 

\subsubsection asics ASiC-S container format
In addition to the Associated Signature Extended form (ASiC-E) the \ref ASiC "ETSI standard TS 102 918" defines a Simple form which is used for encapsulating a single datafile and signature or time-stamp token associated with it.

ASiC-S container is a ZIP file consisting of the following objects:
- an optional file named "mimetype", containing only the following value: application/vnd.etsi.asic-s+zip  
- data object (file) in original format.
- META-INF subdirectory with one of the following files:
  - signatures.p7s
  - signatures.xml
  - timestamp.tst

The libdigidocpp library supports only containers with time-stamp token (container includes META-INF/timestamp.tst). The time-stamp token is a binary representation of TimeStampToken as defined in RFC 3161. The time-stamp is obtained from a time-stamping service; it is calculated over the entire binary content of the data object.
Since both the original file and time-stamp are included in the container, it is possible to verify that the timestamped file existed at a certain point of time.

The library can be used only for reading the content of the container and validating that the time-stamp was indeed issued for the data object included in the container.

Libdigidocpp is a library of C++ classes offering the functionality of handling digitally signed files in supported DigiDoc formats. The following functions are implemented:
- creating containers in supported DigiDoc formats and adding data files;
- creating digital signatures using smart cards or other supported cryptographic tokens;
- adding time marks and validity confirmations to digital signatures using OCSP and time-stamping protocols; 
- validating the digital signatures;
- using trust service status lists (TSL) as trust anchors for certificate validation;
- extracting data files from a container;
- removing signatures and data files from a container.

The following table gives overview of functional features that are supported with Libdigidocpp.
<table>
<tr>
  <th>Feature</th>
  <th>Supported values</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>DigiDoc document format</td>
  <td>
- BDOC 2.1 - the main document format to be used, described in \ref BDOC "BDOC2.1:2013".
- DIGIDOC-XML 1.3 – alternative supported file format, described in \ref DDOC "DigiDoc format". Note that using BDOC 2.1 format is preferred for new documents. 
\note - DIGIDOC-XML 1.3 support has been added to Libdicidocpp via CDigiDoc library (the C library of DigiDoc system, see \ref CDigiDoc "CDigiDoc Programmer's Guide"). Note that the document format is tested in Libdigidocpp indirectly via DigiDoc3 Client desktop application which uses the library as a base layer. 

\note - Older DigiDoc file formats SK-XML, DIGIDOC-XML 1.1 and DIGIDOC-XML 1.2 are supported only for backward compatibility in case of digital signature verification and data file extraction operations (creating new files and modifying existing files is not supported).

\note - BDOC 1.0 file format is not supported (more info can be found from http://www.id.ee/?id=36161).
</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Signature profile</td>
<td>Signature profiles are based on the profiles defined by XAdES (\ref XAdES "XAdES").
- time-stamp (TS) - signature profile in case of which the certificate validity information is added to the signature with an OCSP confirmation; the signing time information is added with a time-stamp token (see also \ref RFC6960 "RFC6960") retrieved from a time-stamping service. In this case, signature creation time is regarded as the issuance time of the time-stamp token (genTime value in the time-stamp). The profile is supported only in case of BDOC 2.1 document format, the "SignatureTimeStamp" element is added to the signature (see also \ref BDOC "BDOC2.1:2013"). Supported since v3.9 of the library.
- time-mark (TM) - certificate validity and signing time information is added to the signature with a time-mark - a special OCSP confirmation in case of which the hash value of the binary value of the signature (along with hash algorithm identifier in case of BDOC 2.1 document format) must be present in the "nonce" field of the OCSP confirmation. In this case, signature creation time is regarded as the issuance time of the OCSP confirmation (producedAt value in the confirmation), additional time-stamp token is not required. 
- archive time-stamp (LTA) - the signature and all the accompanying validation data is time-stamped in order to provide long term validity. The profile is supported only in case of BDOC 2.1 document format, the "ArchiveTimeStamp" element is added to the time-stamp or time-mark signature (see also \ref BDOC "BDOC2.1:2013").
In Libdigidocpp, validation of BDOC 2.1 time-stamp signatures with archive time-stamps is supported since v3.11 of the library.
</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Trust anchors</td>
<td>Information of trusted CA certificates (trust anchors) is used to validate the trustworthiness of certificates used in the signature. The signer certificate's CA, OCSP responder certificate and time-stamping service's certificate (in case of TS signature profile) must be trusted. Trusted certificates' information is obtained from one of the following sources, depending on the signature format and build settings of the library.
- BDOC 2.1 document format: TSL list (Trust Service status list) - the default source of trusted certificates, the trusted certificates' list is retrieved from a signed TSL list that provides information about the status and the status history of the trust services (including certification, OCSP confirmation and time-stamping services). The European Commission's TSL list is used, more information of which can be found from https://ec.europa.eu/information_society/policy/esignature/trusted-list/. For the TSL specification document, see also \ref TSL "Trusted Lists". For more information about the TSL implementation and configuration possibilities in Libdigidocpp library, see \ref TSL-overview and \ref CA-settings. The TSL functionality is supported since v3.9 of the library. 
- DIGIDOC-XML 1.3 document format: the trusted certificates are loaded from digidoc.ini configuration file. See \ref CDigiDoc "CDigiDoc Programmer's Guide" for more information.

\section conf Configuring Libdigidocpp

\tableofcontents
\note The following subchapters describe configuration settings for handling <B>BDOC 2.1</B> files via the Libdigidocpp library's core functionality. Information about applying configuration settings for DIGIDOC-XML 1.3 files (via the CDigiDoc library) has been provided in \ref CDigiDoc "CDigiDoc Programmer's Guide".

\subsection loading Loading configuration settings
Libdigidocpp uses XML configuration file named digidocpp.conf. Configuration file's structure is defined with XML schema "conf.xsd" - the file is included in etc/schema/ subdirectory of Libdigidocpp package. For a sample configuration file, see \ref sample-conf.

It is possible to use two types of configuration files: global and user's file. Global file can be used to determine system-wide settings that cannot be altered by a user's file – it can be done separately for each parameter in the file by setting the parameter's "lock" attribute value to "true". User's file can be used to determine user-specific parameter values. 

It is possible to use only one configuration file (either global or user's file) or two files in parallel. In the latter case, the matching user file's parameter entries overwrite global file's entries, if the respective parameter is not defined as locked in the global file.

By default, the configuration file's settings are loaded during the library's initialization – Libdigidocpp looks for global and user configuration files from their default locations depending on the environment:
- in case of Windows environment:
	- the global configuration file is looked up from the directory where digidocpp.dll library file is located. If the directory doesn't contain /schema subdirectory then the configuration file is looked up from the current working directory.
	- user configuration file is looked up from the system directory containing application data for the current user: \%APPDATA%\\digidocpp\\digidocpp.conf
- in case of OS X:
	- the global configuration file is looked up from a location in the file system: digidocpp.framework/Resources/digidocpp.conf
	- user configuration file is looked up from $HOME/.digidocpp/digidocpp.conf
- in case of Linux environment: 
	- the global configuration file is looked up from a location in the file system: /etc/digidocpp/digidocpp.conf
	- user configuration file is looked up from $HOME/.digidocpp/digidocpp.conf

It is also possible to load global configuration file from a non-default location. In this case, call out the configuration file's initialization method before initializing the library:
\code{.cpp}
	// Initialize global configuration settings from a non-default location
	digidoc::Conf::init(new digidoc::XmlConf("<file-path-and-name>"));
	// then initialize the library
	digidoc::initialize();
\endcode
Local configuration settings can also be set or modified during runtime by calling out the respective set methods of XmlConf class. 
The digidoc::XMLConf class must be used in order to access all the configuration methods that are available. 

\subsection parameters Configuration parameters
Configuration file's elements and their attribute names are defined in conf.xsd file. 
Below is a description of the configuration file's parameters. The attribute "lock", when set to "true" can optionally be used to determine parameter values which should not be overwritten by another configuration file (e.g. when using global and user's configuration files in parallel; see also the previous section for more information).

</td>
</tr>
</table>

\subsubsection CA-settings Trust anchor/TSL settings 
Information of trusted CA certificates (trust anchors) is used to validate the trustworthiness of certificates used in the signature during signing and signature validation processes. The signer certificate's CA, OCSP responder certificate and time-stamping service's certificate (also referred to as time-stamping authority, TSA) must be trusted. 

Libdigidocpp library uses Trust Service Status List (TSL) as a source of trust anchor information (see also \ref TSL-overview and \ref TSL "TSL standard" for more information). A TSL list is a signed XML file that contains data of trusted CA certificates, OCSP responder service and time-stamping service certificates. Note that since v3.10, only TSL lists' based trust anchors are supported by the library.

By default, the trusted certificates' information is obtained from European Commission's official TSL list (https://ec.europa.eu/information_society/policy/esignature/trusted-list/tl-mp.xml). The default TSL behaviour can be changed by altering the configuration parameters listed below. 

\note - The TSL URL and TSL signing certificate values are not configurable via the digidocpp.conf configuration file. The default values are fixed in source code and can be accessed via methods digidoc::Conf::TSLCerts() and digidoc::Conf::TSLUrl(). The library's user has to create a subclass and override the methods in order to define other values. See also \ref initialization. 
\note - When using digidoc-tool utility program then it is possible to specify necessary TSL parameters on the command line. See also \ref utility.
\note - For information about using test TSL lists with Libdigidocpp library, please refer to   https://github.com/open-eid/libdigidocpp/wiki/Using-test-TSL-lists

  The check is based on the TSL list's SHA-256 digest value that is (optionally) published online by the TSL's owner/manager. The URL of the digest matches the TSL's URL, but extension .sha2 is used instead of .xml. If the digest can be read and the value doesn't correspond with the existing local TSL's SHA-256 digest then a newer version of the TSL list is downloaded. Otherwise, the existing TSL is used.

\subsubsection ocspsigning-settings Settings for signing OCSP requests
Whether you need to sign the OCSP requests sent to your OCSP responder or not depends on your responder. Some OCSP servers require that the OCSP request is signed. To sign the OCSP request, you need to obtain and specify the PKCS#12 token, which will be used for signing.

For example, accessing the SK's OCSP Responder service by private persons requires the requests to signed (access certificates can be obtained through registering for the service, see also https://sk.ee/en/services/validity-confirmation-services/) whereas in case of companies/services, signing the request is not required if having a contract with SK and accessing the service from specific IP address(es). It is not necessary to sign OCSP requests in case of using OCSP test-responder (see the next sub-section for more information).

By default, the parameter "pkcs12.disable" value is set to "true" – i.e. the OCSP requests will not be signed. If setting this to "false", you will also need to provide your access certificate file's location and password that have been issued to you for this purpose.

<table>
<tr>
  <th>Parameter name</th>
  <th>Comments</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>pkcs12.disable</td>
  <td>Specifies if the OCSP requests are signed or not. Possible values are: 
true – OCSP requests are not signed; 
false – OCSP requests are signed. 
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>pkcs12.cert</td>
  <td>Specifies your access certificate's PKCS#12 container's filename, e.g. ./home/132936.p12d</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>pkcs12.pass</td>
  <td>Specifies your access certificate's PKCS#12 container's  password, e.g. m15eTGpA</td>
</tr>
</table>




\subsubsection ocspresponder-settings OCSP responder settings

The default OCSP responder that the library uses for retrieving the OCSP confirmation during signature creation depends on the signer's certificate chain:
- in case of SK's live certificates: the SK's live OCSP responder http://ocsp.sk.ee is used
- in case of certificates issued by Finnish, Latvian and Lithuanian CAs: the SK's proxy OCSP responder http://ocsp.sk.ee/_proxy is used

In case of SK's test certificates, the SK's test OCSP responder http://demo.sk.ee/ocsp is used by default (replaces the old test responder URL http://www.openxades.org/cgi-bin/ocsp.cgi). Information about the service can be found and certificates for testing can be loaded at https://demo.sk.ee/upload_cert/. 

You change the default behaviour in the configuration file with the following parameter. 

<table>
<tr>
  <th>Parameter name</th>
  <th>Comments</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>ocsp issuer</td>
  <td>The "issuer" parameter's name stands for the signer certificate issuer's Common Name (CN) value, e.g. ESTEID-SK 2007. The element's value specifies OCSP responder server's URL address that is used for certificates issued from the respective CA chain. 
</td>
</tr>
</table>

\subsection sample-conf Sample configuration file
\includelineno src/digidocpp.conf






\section usage Using Libdigidocpp API

\tableofcontents
Note that Libdigidocpp uses internal memory buffers in case of all the operations, so that intermediary data is not written to temporary files on the disk. Also, the data files to be added to a DigiDoc container can be read from a data stream and later extracted from the container to a stream so that the data can be kept in memory.

\subsection initialization Initialization
Libdigidocpp's initialization method conducts the following operations: 
1. initializes dependent libraries (see also \ref libraries)
2. loads configuration settings from default configuration files 
3. initializes trust anchors: initializes TSL lists (if TSL support is enabled in the library and USE_TSL build parameter has been set during build time). See \ref TSL-init for more information about the TSL initialization process.


If you would like to use non-default configuration settings then call out the configuration file's initialization before initializing the library, for example:
\code{.cpp}
    // Optionally initialize global configuration file to use non-default settings
    digidoc::Conf::init(new digidoc::XmlConf("<file-path-and-name>"));
    // Initialize the library
    digidoc::initialize();
\endcode

The digidoc::XMLConf class must be used in order to access all the configuration methods that are available. 

\note If you would like to use different configuration values that are fixed as constants in the digidoc::Conf configuration class then it is possible to extend the class and override the values that need to be reset.





\subsection creating Creating and signing a DigiDoc document (local signing)

\subsubsection containercreate Creating a DigiDoc container
Create a new container object and specify the DigiDoc document's type, for example:
\code{.cpp}
    digidoc::Container *doc = digidoc::Container::create("<output-file's-path>"); // create new container
\endcode
Container class is used to incorporate the data of a DigiDoc document.

The output file name's extension is used by the library to determine the container format that is used. E.g., in case of *.ddoc extension, the container is created in DIGIDOC-XML 1.3 format, in case of *.asice or *.bdoc extensions, BDOC 2.1 container format is used. 




\subsubsection adddatafile Adding data files
Data files can be added to a DigiDoc container in two alternative ways:
1. adding the data from an input stream (i.e. the data file contents can be read from internal memory buffer):
\code{.cpp}
    void digidoc::Container::addDataFile(std::istream *is, // input stream
    const std::string &fileName, // file name that is written to the container
    const std::string &mediaType); // mime type of the data file
\endcode
2. adding the data by reading the it from file system
\code{.cpp}
    void digidoc::Container::addDataFile(const std::string &path, //data file's name and path in file system
    const std::string &mediaType); // mime type of the data file
\endcode

Parameter mediaType in the methods above stands for a MIME type of the data file, for example "text/plain" or "application/msword". Value "application/octet-stream" is used by default.
Calling out any of the methods listed above shall create a new DataFile object and add it to the DigiDoc container's data file collection.
Note that in order to add a data file to a container, the container has to be unsigned and there shouldn't be an existing data file with the same name in the container. If a container is signed then it is possible to add data files to it only after the signatures are removed.

\warning - In case of BDOC 2.1 documents, it is important to pay attention that the data file's mime type value in manifest.xml file and in signatures*.xml file's &lt;DataObjectFormat&gt;&lt;MimeType&lt; element are the same, otherwise the signature is invalid! In case of the ordinary signature creation process, the library sets the correct value automatically. However, if you create a BDOC 2.1 container with Libdigidocpp library and want to add signatures*.xml file that you have received from another source (e.g. from DigiDocService) then make sure that the data files' mime-type values in manifest-xml file and in signatures*.xml file are the same.


\warning - Data file’s mime-type value must be formatted as specified in RFC2045, section 5.1 (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2045#section-5.1), i.e. the "type" and "subtype" values must be separated with a forward slash character. 


\warning - It is recommended not to use special characters in the data file’s name, i.e. it is suggested to only use the characters that are categorized as "unreserved" according to RFC3986 (http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986).

\note By default, it is recommended to use data file mime-type value "application/octet-stream" for all file types. 



\subsubsection API-add-sign Adding signatures
It is possible to add a signature to a container only if it contains at least one data file, multiple signatures can be added to a single container. The signer's certificate and PIN code to access the private signature key are required during signing.

\note In case of BDOC 2.1 documents, Libdigidocpp library uses TSL lists (Trust Service Status list) to obtain information about trusted certificates during signature creation process. See also \ref TSL-overview "TSL overview", \ref TSL "TSL standard" and \ref CA-settings "Configuring TSL settings". 
\note In case of DIGIDOC-XML 1.3 documents, the \ref CDigiDoc "CDigiDoc library's" trust store mechanism is used.


To start adding signatures, firstly declare pointer to the Signature object to be created:
\code{.cpp}
    digidoc::Signature *signature = 0;
\endcode

Signing can be done by using PKCS#11 module for accessing the signature token. PKCS#11 module is the default module for singing with smart card (e.g. Estonian ID card or any other smart card provided that you have the external native language PKCS#11 driver for it). See also \ref pkcs11-settings.
\code{.cpp}
    digidoc::PKCS11Signer *signer = new digidoc::PKCS11Signer("<PKCS11-driver-path>");
    // optionally specify PKCS#11 driver's location. If left  unspecified then location is
    // looked up from configuration file's parameter "pkcs11.driver.path".
	std::string pin = "<pin-code>"; //PIN2 in case of Estonian ID cards
    signer->setPin(pin); 
\endcode
If you would like to add PIN insertion dialog window for the signer to enter the PIN code then you can write a new class which extends the PKCS11Signer class, overwrite the std::string pin(const X509Cert &cert) method and write your own PIN dialog implementation code there.


\paragraph API-sign-profile Optionally specify the signature profile 
The supported signature profiles are (see also \ref Supported, under "Signature profiles"):
- "time-stamp" (TS) - signature profile in case of which the certificate validity information is added to the signature with an OCSP confirmation (retrieved from OCSP server); the signing time information is added with a time-stamp token (retrieved from a time-stamping service). Signature creation time is the issuance time of the time-stamp token (value of the getTime field in the token). The profile is supported only in case of BDOC 2.1 document format, since v3.9 of the library.
- "time-mark" (TM) - certificate validity and signing time information is added to the signature with a time-mark (an OCSP confirmation with a specific "nonce" value). Signature creation time is the time-mark's issuance time (i.e. the OCSP confirmation's producedAt field's value). 

\warning When adding signature to an existing BDOC 2.1 container then the profile of the existing signature should be used for all of the new signatures in the same container. Signature's profile can be determined with method digidoc::Signature.profile().

If the signature profile value is not specified then then a "time-stamp" profile is used by default.

Set the profile value as follows:
\code{.cpp}
std::string profile = "<signature-profile>"; // "time-mark" or "time-stamp"
signer->setProfile(profile);
\endcode


\paragraph API-sign-data Optionally specify additional signer's data
Signature production place and signer role are optional signed meta-data about the signature. If left unspecified then the respective elements in the signatures*.xml file are created with no contents.
\code{.cpp}
    std::string city, state, postalCode, country;
    std::vector<std::string> roles;
    signer->setSignatureProductionPlace(city, state, postalCode, country); // location where the signature is created
    signer->setSignerRoles(roles); // role(s) of the signer
\endcode

\paragraph API-signature-hash Optionally specify signature digest method
By default, the hash that is being signed is calculated with SHA-256 algorithm in case of BDOC documents and SHA-1 algorithm in case of DDOC documents. 
In case of BDOC format, you can also use a different digest algorithm for calculating the hash that is signed (this does not affect calculating other hash values). For that, use the digidoc::Signer::setMethod(const std::string &method) method.


\paragraph API-sign-create Create the signature
The signing method also adds validation data from external services (OCSP and/or time-stamping servers). Note that the OCSP responder and time-stamping server settings (in case of TS profile) should be configured before calling out the following method (see also \ref initialization and \ref parameters). By default, the SK's time-stamping service http://tsa.sk.ee/ is used. 


\code{.cpp}
signature = doc.sign(signer);
\endcode



\paragraph validatesig Validating the created signatures
After the signature has been added to the container, it should be validated before writing the signed container to an output file. For validating the signature, do as follows:
\code{.cpp}
    signature->validate();
\endcode
The validation method above validates the signed data files', signer certificate's and OCSP confirmation's correspondence to the signature value. Note that the validation method above does not validate other signatures which may belong to the same container.

\note See also \ref validate about more information for validating existing signatures and signature containers.


\subsection websigning Creating and signing a DigiDoc document (external signing, e.g. in browser)
External signing (two-step signing) can be used in case of signing in web applications, where the signature value is calculated externally, via a browser plug-in or extension. 

In order to conduct web signing with Libdigidocpp library, do as follows:

1. In Container class, prepare signature XML structure:
\code{.cpp}
virtual Signature* digidoc::Container::prepareSignature(Signer *signer);
\endcode

2. In Signature class, get the hash to be signed in browser:
\code{.cpp}
std::vector<unsigned char> digidoc::Signature::dataToSign() const;
\endcode

3. Sign the hash in browser (e.g. use the <a href="https://github.com/open-eid/hwcrypto.js">hwcrypto.js library </a>)

4. Add RSA signature value to the signature XML structure:
\code{.cpp}
void digidoc::Signature::setSignatureValue(const std::vector<unsigned char> &signatureValue);
\endcode

5. Add time-stamp and OCSP data to Signature object, according to the signature's profile (see also section \ref API-sign-profile for more information):
\code{.cpp}
void digidoc::Signature::extendSignatureProfile(const std::string &profile);
\endcode

6. Write the document to output, as specified in section \ref containeropen


\subsection containeropen Reading and writing DigiDoc documents
In order to read an existing DigiDoc file from the file system, do as follows:
\code{.cpp}
    digidoc::Container::open("<input-file's-path>");
\endcode
The method above reads in the DigiDoc file from the specified location in file system and
creates the respective Container object representing the document's data. The file's structure
is also validated during its parsing according to the corresponding standards (see also for <a href="http://id.ee/public/DigiDoc_format_1.3.pdf">DIGIDOC XML 1.3</a> documents, for <a href="https://www.sk.ee/repository/bdoc-spec21.pdf">BDOC 2.1</a> documents and for <a href="http://id.ee/public/bdoc-spec212-eng.pdf">BDOC 2.1.2</a> documents).

Write a DigiDoc file (represented with a Container object) to file system with the following method:
\code{.cpp}
    digidoc::Container::save("<output-file's-path>");
\endcode

\note In case of read-only formats (e.g. ASiC-S documents), the save will throw a digidoc::Exception.

\subsection validate Validating signature containers and signatures
Validation of a signed DigiDoc document consists of three main steps:
1.	Call out the main validation method of the library. If there are multiple validation errors then get the errors list.
2.	Check for additional errors/warnings (separate implementation);
3.	Determine the validation status of the document (according to the returned error codes and validation status priorities).

\note In case of BDOC 2.1 documents, Libdigidocpp library uses TSL lists (Trust Service Status list) to obtain information about trusted certificates during signature validation process. See also \ref TSL-overview "TSL overview", \ref TSL "TSL standard" and \ref CA-settings "Configuring TSL settings". 
\note In case of DIGIDOC-XML 1.3 documents, the \ref CDigiDoc "CDigiDoc library's" trust store mechanism is used.

 

\subsubsection main-method Using the main validation method
You can validate a signature and its validation data - OCSP confirmation and time-stamp (in case of TS profile) - with method: 
\code{.cpp}
void digidoc::Signature::validate();
\endcode
If an exception is thrown from the validation method then the signature can be either <b>INVALID</b> or <b>VALID WITH WARNINGS</b>; otherwise the signature is VALID. Before determining the final validation status, additional errors must be checked, as described in the following chapters.

If an exception is thrown then its causes can be retrieved with the following method:
\code{.cpp}
std::vector<digidoc::Exception> digidoc::Exception::causes();
\endcode

\subsubsection additional Checking for additional errors/warnings
There is a validation case that is not checked in the default validation method of the library, instead, separate method for checking this specific situation has to be implemented by the library’s user. In Libdigidocpp library, checking for an old file format must be done separately. 

The following subchapter describes how this check can be implemented. After checking for old signature format errors/warnings, collect all of the error codes and continue with determining the validation status as described in the next chapter.

\paragraph old-format Checking for old file formats
Sample for checking old versions can be found from two sources.
1.	 CDigiDoc library’s utility program’s source code in cdigidoc.c source file, method 
\code{.cpp}
cmdReadDigiDoc(SignedDoc** ppSigDoc, DEncEncryptedData** ppEncData, int nMode); //utility program’s command -in
\endcode
The check for old file formats is implemented in method:
\code{.cpp}
 checkOldFormatVer(SignedDoc* pSigDoc);
 \endcode
2.	It is possible to check the source code of DigiDoc3 Client desktop application, accessible from https://github.com/open-eid/qdigidoc.


\subsubsection validation-status Determining the validation status
After validating the signed DigiDoc document, the validation result must be determined by the library's user. Final validation result must be one of the possible validation statuses that are described in the table below, the status must be chosen according to its priority.
The validation status priorities have to be applied in two cases:
1. <b>Returning a validation result of a single signature:</b><br>
If there are more than one validation errors that occur when validating a single signature in DigiDoc container then the overall status of the signature should be chosen according to the status priorities.
2. <b>Returning a validation result of the whole DigiDoc container:</b><br>
If there are more than one signatures in a DigiDoc container and the signatures have different validation statuses or validation of the container structure returns a different status then the overall status of the DigiDoc file should be chosen according to the status priorities.

<b>NB! User of the library has to determine the validation status according to the error code that is returned by the library's validation method.</b>

\endcode

\paragraph validatewarnings Validation status VALID WITH WARNINGS
In special cases, validation errors can be regarded as minor technical errors and the file's validation status can be regarded as VALID WITH WARNINGS instead.

\warning User of the DigiDoc library has to decide on his/her own when to use VALID WITH WARNINGS status instead of INVALID: there may be different interpretations of the severity of validation errors in different information systems then the final decision when to use this
status has to be made by the library's user according to the requirements of the specific information system.

It is recommended to use the validation status VALID WITH WARNINGS in case of the error situations that are included in the table below - these error situations are regarded as VALID WITH WARNINGS in DigiDoc applications and software libraries, including:
- DigiDoc3 Client desktop application,
- JDigiDoc, Libdigidocpp and CDigiDoc software libraries' utility programs.

\subsubsection validation-info	Additional information about validation
\paragraph validation-overview Overview of validation activities
Overview of validation activities is as follows: 
1. checking that all the data files and signature’s meta-data (signer’s role, etc.) are included in the signature by calculating the data objects’ digest values and comparing them with the &lt;Reference&gt; element values in the signature; 
2. checking that the claimed signer’s certificate is the actual certificate that was used for signing; checking that the "Non-repudiaton" value is set in the "Key Usage" extension of the signer’s certificate;
3. checking that the signature value is correct by decrypting the value with the signer’s public key and comparing the result with digest calculated from &lt;SignedInfo&gt; element block;
4. checking that the OCSP response confirms the signer certificate’s validity and corresponds to the signature value (by comparing the digest value of &lt;SignatureValue&gt; element’s value and OCSP response’s nonce value);
5. checking that the signer’s and OCSP responder’s certificates are trusted (i.e. the certificates’ issuers are registered in trust store).

\note In case of BDOC 2.1 documents, Libdigidocpp library uses TSL lists (Trust Service Status list) to obtain information about trusted certificates during signature validation process. See also \ref TSL-overview "TSL overview", \ref TSL "TSL standard" and \ref CA-settings "Configuring TSL settings". 
\note In case of DIGIDOC-XML 1.3 documents, the \ref CDigiDoc "CDigiDoc library's" trust store mechanism is used.

\subsection extracting Extracting data files
A data file can be extracted from container and written to the specified location in the file system or to an output stream. 
1.	You can write the data file to a stream and keep it in memory:
\code{.cpp}
void digidoc::DataFile::saveAs(std::ostream &os);
\endcode

2.	The file can be written to file system with the following method:
\code{.cpp}
void digidoc::DataFile::saveAs(const std::string& path);
\endcode

List of all the document’s data files can be retrieved with the following method:
\code{.cpp}
std::vector<digidoc::DataFile> digidoc::Container::dataFiles();
\endcode

For example, read in a DigiDoc document and write its data files to file system as follows: 
\code{.cpp}
digidoc::Container doc("<input-file’s-path>"); // read in a document 
for(const digidoc::DataFile &file: doc.dataFiles()){ // get the data files’ list
	try {
		std::string dst = file.fileName(); // get the data file’s name
		file.saveAs(dst); // save the data file to working directory
	} catch(const digidoc::Exception &e) {
		printf("  Document %s extraction: FAILED\n", file.fileName().c_str());
	}
}
\endcode

\subsection removing Removing signatures and data files
In order to remove a signature from DigiDoc document, use the following method:
\code{.cpp}
void digidoc::Container::removeSignature(unsigned int id); 
\endcode

Data files can be removed from a container only after all of its signatures have been removed. Use the following method to remove a data file from DigiDoc container:
\code{.cpp}
void digidoc::Container::removeDataFile(unsigned int id);
\endcode

"Id" parameters of the abovementioned methods represent the signature’s and data file’s sequence numbers in the container. The identifiers are determined when a data file or signature is added to the container, counting starts from zero. 
\note The functionality of modifying files in DigiDoc file formats SK-XML, DIGIDOC-XML 1.1, DIGIDOC-XML 1.2 and ASiC-S is not supported.


\subsection shutting-down Shutting down the library
After finishing work with Libdigidocpp, then the last task is to shut down the library:
\code{.cpp}
digidoc::terminate();
\endcode

The termination method closes libraries used in Libdigidocpp implementation and deletes temporary files that may have been written to disk when working with the library.

\subsection exceptions Exception handling
The Libdigidocpp library may throw exceptions that are instances of Exception class (defined in Exception.h source file). The code which uses Libdigidocpp’s API should be wrapped in a try/catch block as follows: 
\code{.cpp}
try { 

// code implementation

} catch(const digidoc::Exception &e) {  
    printf("Exception:%s\n", parseException(e).c_str()); // Sample exception 
  							// handling method
}
\endcode

An Exception instance thrown by the library may contain a stack trace of the hierarchy of exceptions. For example, to parse the whole stack trace, do as follows: 
\code{.cpp}
std::string parseException(const digidoc::Exception &e)
{
    std::string result = e.msg() + "\n"; // the error message is retrieved
    // Iteration through the list of causes:
    for(const digidoc::Exception &ex: e.causes())
        result += parseException(ex); // Parsing the exceptions recursively
    return result; // The error message is returned
}
\endcode


\section utility Libdigidocpp utility program

The command line utility program digidoc-tool.exe which is included in the Libdigidocpp distribution can be used to test the library or simply use it directly to handle digitally signed documents.

\note The utility program is intended for testing and presentation of sample implementation of the library’s API. The interface of the utility program is not fixed and its long-term stability is not guaranteed. 

The general format for executing the program is:
\code{.txt}
> digidoc-tool [command] [options] [input/output file]
\endcode

\subsection	Creating Creating and signing a document (local signing)

Command "create" can be used to create a new DigiDoc container, add data files, optionally some meta-info about the signer and sign the document. Documents can be created only in BDOC 2.1 format.
General form of the command is:
\code{.txt}
> digidoc-tool create --file=<data-file> <output-bdoc-file>
\endcode 

Available options:
<table>
<tr><td>
\-\-file=	</td><td>Required

Data file(s) to be signed. The option can occur multiple times. 

\warning It is recommended not to use special characters in the data file’s name, i.e. it is suggested to only use the characters that are categorized as "unreserved" according to RFC3986 (http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986).

</td></tr><tr><td>
\-\-mime=	</td><td>Optional

Specifies the data file's mime-type value. When used then must be written right after the "--file" parameter. If left unspecified then the default mime-type value "application/octet-stream" is used.

\warning Data file’s mime-type value must be formatted as specified in RFC2045, section 5.1 (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2045#section-5.1), i.e. the "type" and "subtype" values must be separated with a forward slash character. 

</td></tr>
</table>

Additional options for the "create" command are the same as for "sign" command (see \ref Adding).

Sample commands for creating and signing DigiDoc files:

\code{.txt}
Sample: creating new BDOC file, adding multiple data files and signing via PKCS#11 driver
> digidoc-tool create --file=file1.txt --mime=text/plain --file=file2.pdf --mime=application/pdf --country=Estonia 
--state=Harjumaa --city=Tallinn --postalCode=12345 --pkcs11 demo-container.bdoc

Input:
  - file1.txt 			- a data file to be added to container
  - text/plain			- data file mime-type
  - file2.pdf			- a data file to be added to container	
  - application/pdf		- data file mime-type
  - Estonia			- country where the signature is created
  - Harjumaa			- county where the signature is created
  - Tallinn			- city where the signature is created
  - 12345			- postal code of the signature creation location
  - --pkcs11			- signing is done via PKCS#11 module
  - demo-container.bdoc	- container to be created (in BDOC 2.1 format)
\endcode

\code{.txt}
Sample: creating new BDOC file, adding data file and signing via CNG API
> digidoc-tool create --file=file1.txt --cng demo-container.bdoc 

Input:
  - file1.txt 			- a data file to be added to container
  - --cng			- CNG API is used for signing
  - demo-container.bdoc	- container to be created (in BDOC 2.1 format)
\endcode

\code{.txt}
Sample: creating new BDOC file, adding data file and signing via CNG API, dialog windows for certificate selection and PIN insertion are not displayed
> digidoc-tool create --file=file1.txt --cng --selectFirst --pin=01497 demo-container.bdoc 

Input:
  - file1.txt 			- a data file to be added to container
  - --cng			- CNG API is used for signing
  - --selectFirst	- the first signing certificate in store is used for signing
  - 01497			- PIN code (PIN2 in case of Estonian ID cards)
  - demo-container.bdoc	- container to be created (in BDOC 2.1 format)
\endcode

\subsection	websign Creating and signing a document (external signing, e.g. in browser)

Command "websign" can be used to create a new DigiDoc container, add data files, optionally some meta-info about the signer and sign the document. Documents can be created only in BDOC 2.1 format.
External signing use case may be used when signing is done in web applications, the communication with the signer's token and signing the hash is done via a web browser's signing module (plug-in or extension). See also  https://github.com/open-eid/hwcrypto.js for implementing signing in browser environment. 

External signing process with websign command is as follows: 
1. After executing the websign command, the utility program outputs the value of hash to be signed (in HEX) to console and waits until user enters the respective signature value
2. Send the hash to be signed to the signing token (e.g. by using the web signing demo page at https://open-eid.github.io/hwcrypto.js/sign.html)
3. Conduct signing, enter PIN2, retireve the signed hash (signature value) from the signing token
4. Enter the signature value (also in HEX) to the console
5. Utility program continues with signing process and outputs the signed container

General form of the command is:
\code{.txt}
> digidoc-tool websign --cert=<signer-certificate> --file=<data-file> <output-bdoc-file>
\endcode 

Available options:
<table>
<tr><td>
\-\-cert=	</td><td>Required

Signer's certificate, in PEM format. 
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
\-\-file=	</td><td>Required

Data file(s) to be signed. The option can occur multiple times. 
</td></tr><tr><td>
\-\-mime=	</td><td>Optional

Specifies the data file's mime-type value. When used then must be written right after the "--file" parameter. If left unspecified then the default mime-type value "application/octet-stream" is used.
</td></tr>
</table>

Additional options for the "websign" command are the same as for "sign" command (see \ref Adding).

Sample commands for creating and external signing of BDOC files:

\code{.txt}
Sample: creating new BDOC-TM file, specifying signers certificate, adding data file and calculating the RSA signature value in browser
> digidoc-tool websign --cert=signer.cer --file=file1.txt --profile=time-mark demo-container.bdoc 

Input:
  - signer.cer 			- signer's certificate
  - file1.txt 			- a data file to be added to container

\endcode

\code{.txt}
Sample: creating new BDOC-TS file, specifying signer's certificate, adding data files and other meta-data and calculating the RSA signature value in browser
> digidoc-tool websign --cert=signer.cer --file=file1.txt --file=file2.pdf --country=Estonia --state=Harjumaa --city=Tallinn --postalCode=12345 --profile=time-stamp demo-container.bdoc

Input:
  - signer.cer 			- signer's certificate
  - file1.txt 			- a data file to be added to container
  - file2.txt 			- a data file to be added to container
  - time-stamp			- profile of the signature

\endcode


\subsection	Opening Opening document, validating signatures and extracting data files
Command "open" enables to read in an existing DigiDoc document, print out a list of its contents and validate signatures. By specifying the additional option --extractaAll, then the data files are extracted from the container and stored on the disk. All DigiDoc file formats are supported with this command (except of BDOC1.0).
General form of the command is:
\code{.txt}
> digidoc-tool open <input-container-file> 
\endcode

Available options:
<table>
<tr><td>
\-\-extractAll	</td><td>Optional

If set, then all of the input container’s data files are extracted and written to disk. If an output directory is not specified with the value of this parameter then the extracted files are written to the same directory where the input file is located. 
</td></tr><tr><td>
\-\-warnings=
(ignore, warning, error)	</td><td>Optional

Enables to choose the displaying of validation warnings (if present) of the file being opened. Can be used to test the warnings system of the utility program (see also "Validation status VALID WITH WARNINGS"). 
The options include:
-	warning – the default value used. The minor technical errors that are considered as warnings, are printed out as warnings.
-	 error – the errors that are otherwise considered as warnings (by the utility program), are printed out as errors. 
-	ignore – the errors that are otherwise considered as warnings (by the utility program), are not printed out. If there are any other errors present then these are treated as usual.
</td></tr>
</table>

Output of the default command contains the following data of the container:
\code{.txt}
  Container type: <container’s mime-type>
  Documents (<number of data files in container>):
    Document (<data file’s mime-type>): <file’s name> (<file’s size> bytes)
  Signatures (<number of signatures in container>):
    Signature <signature’s sequence number> (<signature’s profile>):
      Validation: <signature validation result: OK/FAILED>
      EPES policy: urn:oid: <signature policy identifier OID> 
      SPUri: <URL to the BDOC 2.1 specification document>
      Signature method: <signature method URI> 
      Signing time: <signing time according to computer’s settings (not the     
             official signing time)>
      Signing cert: <subject CN field’s value>
      Produced At: <time of OCSP response’s issuance, i.e. official signing time>
      OCSP Responder: <OCSP responder certificate CN field’s value>
      OCSP Nonce (<length in bytes>): <OCSP responses nonce field’s value (has to 
            correspond to the &lt;SignatureValue&gt; element’s hash)>
      Warnings: <possible validation related warnings (see explanation below)>
\endcode

\note By default, if the signature validation process discovered errors that are regarded as minor technical errors in digidoc-tool.cpp utility program then the document is considered as VALID WITH WARNINGS, the errors are printed out as warnings to the end user. See also chapter \ref validation-status.

\subsection	Adding Adding signatures
Command "sign" enables adding signatures to existing DigiDoc containers. The supported DigiDoc document formats are DIGIDOC-XML 1.3 and BDOC 2.1.
\code{.txt}
> digidoc-tool sign <modified-digidoc-container> 
\endcode

<table>
<tr><td>
\-\-pin=	</td><td>Optional

If PIN is not provided with this parameter value and (the default) PKCS#11 module is used for signing then the utility program asks for the user to insert PIN code to command line during the program’s execution time.
</td></tr><tr><td>
\-\-profile=	</td><td>Optional

Profile of the signature. Possible values are: 
- TM - a time-mark will be added to the signature as validation data; 
- TS - a time-stamp and OCSP confirmation will be added to the signature as validation data.

\warning When adding signature to an existing BDOC 2.1 container then the profile of the existing signature should be used for all of the new signatures in the same container. 

</td></tr><tr><td>
\-\-city=	</td><td>Optional

City where the signature is created.
</td></tr><tr><td>
\-\-state=	</td><td>Optional

State or province where the signature is created.
</td></tr><tr><td>
\-\-postalCode=	</td><td>Optional

Postal code of the place where the signature is created.
</td></tr><tr><td>
\-\-country=	</td><td>Optional

Country of origin. ISO 3166-type 2-character country codes are used (e.g. EE)
</td></tr><tr><td>
\-\-role=	</td><td>Optional

Signer’s role(s). The option can occur multiple times.
</td></tr><tr><td>
\-\-sha(1,224,
256,384,512)	</td><td>Optional

Used for testing purposes. Specifies the hash function that is used when calculating digest values, supported only in case of BDOC documents. If not specified then SHA-256 is used by default.
</td></tr><tr><td>
\-\-sigsha(1,224,256,384,512)	</td><td>Optional

Used for testing purposes. Specifies the hash function that is used for calculating the hash that is being signed, supported only in case of BDOC format. If not specified then SHA-256 is used by default.
</td></tr>
</table>


Options for specifying module used for accessing the signing token - possible alternatives are PKCS#11, CryptoAPI/CNG and PKCS#12 (for testing purposes). When signing module is not specified then PKCS#11 module is used by default. 
<table>
<tr><td>
\-\-pkcs11[=]	</td><td>Optional

Signing is done via PKCS#11 module - the default module for singing with smart card in Linux and OS X. When signing via PKCS#11 module then the parameter’s value can be used to specify the path and filename of PKCS#11 driver in your file system. For example, "opensc-pkcs11.dll" in Windows environment and "opensc-pkcs11.so" in Linux and OSX.
If the parameter’s value is left unspecified then PKCS#11 driver’s location is looked up from configuration file (see also chap. \ref parameters).
</td></tr><tr><td>
\-\-cng  	</td><td>Optional

Set the parameter to sign via Microsoft CNG API (in Windows environment). If "--pin" parameter’s value is not set then PIN insertion dialog is displayed to the user. Parameter "--cng" may optionally be used along with parameter "--selectFirst".
</td></tr><tr><td>
\-\-selectFirst  	</td><td>Optional

Additional parameter that can optionally be used along with parameter "–cng". When the parameter is set then the first certificate in Windows certificate store is chosen for signature creation. If the parameter is not set then certificate selection dialog window is displayed to user.
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
\-\-pkcs12=	</td><td>Optional

Signing is done via PKCS#12 module - can be used for testing purposes, currently has been used for testing signature creation with ECC keys. Enables to use a PKCS#12 software token (containing the signing certificate and private key) for signature creation. Note that the created signature is not a valid signature and it is not equal to handwritten signature as the PKCS#12 software token is not considered a secure signature creation device.

\endcode

Available options:
<table>
<tr><td>
\-\-document=	</td><td>Optional

Specifies the sequence number of the data file that is removed from the container. The sequence numbers are counted from zero.
</td></tr><tr><td>
\-\-signature=	</td><td>Optional

\section supported-tokens National and cross-border support

\subsection TSL-overview TSL list usage in Libdigidocpp
In case of <b>BDOC 2.1 documents</b>, Libdigidocpp library uses Trust Service status Lists (TSL) as trust anchors. TSL lists are a standardized way to add support for cross-border trust-service providers, e.g. CA's that issue qualified certificates, OCSP service and time-stamping service providers (see also \ref TSL "TSL specification"). TSL list is a digitally signed a document in XML format, the list is accompanied with a TSL signing certificate that is used to validate the list's signature.

\warning TSL lists are used only in case of BDOC 2.1 document format. For DIGIDOC-XML 1.3 (DDOC) documents, the \ref CDigiDoc "CDigiDoc library's" trusted CA certificates mechanism is used. 

Libdigidocpp library uses the <b>European Commission’s TSL list </b> as the basis of retrieving data of trusted certificates. The European Commission's TSL list is also referred to as List of Trusted Lists (LOTL), meaning that it is central list that contains references to other TSL lists, in this case the national TSL lists of the European Union's member states. 
\note The European Commission's TSL that contains URL's and certificates of the national TSL lists can be downloaded here: https://ec.europa.eu/information_society/policy/esignature/trusted-list/tl-mp.xml

Each of the national TSL list contains data (including the certificates) of the trust service providers that are approved in this particular country. Libdigidocpp supports <b>all national TSL lists that are referred to in the LOTL (more than 30 countries). </b> 

Note that TSL lists are supported since v3.9 of the library. Since v3.10 of the library, TSL lists are the only supported source of trusted certificates (i.e. in case of BDOC 2.1 document format).

\note For information about using test TSL lists with Libdigidocpp library, please refer to   https://github.com/open-eid/libdigidocpp/wiki/Using-test-TSL-lists



\subsubsection TSL-init TSL initialization process 

TSL lists' initialization process is done during each initialization of the library. By default, the TSL itself and its freshness is checked on-line:
1. It is checked if LOTL (the master TSL list, tl-mp.xml) is present at the tsl.cache location 

2. If there is no such list present in the cache directory and the online updating mechanism is enabled (see \ref CA-settings, "tsl.autoupdate") then the TSL list is downloaded from the list's URL (https://ec.europa.eu/information_society/policy/esignature/trusted-list/tl-mp.xml) and saved to tsl.cache directory
\note tsl.autoupdate can be disabled but then the TSL list(s) must be manually saved to the tsl.cache location.

\note the TSL lists are not distributed along with the library's installation package, meaning that during the first initialization of the library, the TSL lists need to be downloaded on-line or must be manually copied to the tsl.cache location.

3. If there is an existing LOTL in the tsl.cache location and the tsl.onlineDigest check is enabled (see \ref CA-settings, "tsl.onlineDigest") then the freshness of the TSL list is checked based on the list's SHA-256 hash value: 
	- The existing TSL list’s hash is calculated over the binary representation of the list
	- The officially published hash value is downloaded (from the same address as the TSL's URL but with .sha2 extension)
	- The hash of existing TSL and the value downloaded on-line are compared
		- If values are different then a new version of the TSL list is downloaded
		- If the hash values are the same or it was not possible to download the hash value from external URL then new version of the TSL is not downloaded. TSL parsing/validation process is continued.

4. The LOTL is validated:
	- the list's validity is checked in by comparing the user's computer time with the list's &lt;NextUpdate&gt; value. 
		- if the list is not valid then the library attempts to download a new list from the list's URL
	- the list's signature is validated by using its signing certificate
5. National TSLs' data (URLs and certificates) are read from the LOTL. 
6. For each of the national TSL list, the following is done:
	- step 1-3 of the current process is repeated with the national TSL list 
	- appropriate trust services are found from the national TSL lists, their certificates are added to the library's internal trusted certificates' store.  

\note Proxy settings are ignored in case of HTTPS connections when downloading TSL lists.

\subsection	tokens Identity tokens in Libdigidocpp
Libdigidocpp library supports the following identity tokens:
- Estonian national eID card and Digi-ID

The library is also tested with the following tokens (indirectly via the DigiDoc3 Client desktop application that uses Libdigidocpp as a base component):
- Finnish national eID card
- Latvian national eID card
- Lithuanian national eID card
- Aladdin eToken USB authenticator with SK issued certificates for organizations











\section testing Interoperability testing
\subsection cross-usability DigiDoc framework cross-usability tests
Automated cross-usability tests of digitally signed and encrypted files are periodically carried out between different \ref DD-libs "DigiDoc software libraries":
- Cross-usability tests of digitally signed files in DIGIDOC-XML 1.3 format (.ddoc files) are carried out between JDigiDoc and CDigiDoc software libraries.
- Cross-usability of BDOC 2.1 (.bdoc or .asice) file format with TM (time-mark) profile is tested between JDigiDoc and Libdigidocpp libraries.
- Cross-usability of BDOC 2.1 (.bdoc or .asice) file format with Ts (time-stamp) profile is tested between DigiDoc4j and Libdigidocpp libraries.
- Cross-usability of encrypted file format CDOC 1.0 is carried out between JDigiDoc and CDigiDoc software libraries.
The interoperability tests are executed through the command line utility tools of the software libraries (for example, in case of Libdigidocpp library, the utility program which is described in chapter \ref utility of the current document).





\section implementation-notes Libdigidocpp implementation notes
The following section describes properties of a BDOC 2.1 file that are not strictly defined in the BDOC 2.1 specification \ref BDOC "BDOC2.1:2013" but are used in Libdigidocpp library’s implementation (and also in other DigiDoc software libraries) of the file format.


\subsection signature-notes Digital signature related notes
1.	The supported BDOC 2.1 signature profiles are BDOC-TM (XAdES-EPES signature with time-mark) and BDOC-TS (XAdES-BES signature with time-stamp and OCSP confirmation).
The basic BDOC-TM profile is XAdES-EPES as BDOC 2.1 specification requires that &lt;SignaturePolicyIdentifier&gt; element is present (\ref BDOC "BDOC2.1:2013", chap. 5.2). The basic BDOC-TS profile is XAdES-BES as the &lt;SignaturePolicyIdentifier&gt; element is not supported in case of BDOC 2.1 signatures with time-stamps.
It is expected that either a time-mark or time-stamp and OCSP confirmation have been added to the signature as according to BDOC 2.1 specification (\ref BDOC "BDOC2.1:2013", chap. 6) a signature is not considered complete or valid without validation data from external services (i.e. a time-mark or time-stamp). 
2.	For better international compatibility reasons, the library also accepts BDOC-TS signatures that are based on XAdES-EPES basic profile during validation time (i.e. the signature contains &lt;SignaturePolicyIdentifier&gt; element and a time-stamp).
3.	One time-mark is allowed for each signature in case of TM profile; one time-stamp and one OCSP confirmation are allowed for each signature in case of TS profile (due to security reasons and in order to maintain testing efficiency).
4.	In case of BDOC signature with time-mark, the OCSP confirmation's (i.e. time-mark's) nonce field’s value is calculated as follows: 
	-	the contents of &lt;SignatureValue&gt; element (i.e. the value without XML tags) is taken and decoded from base64 encoding;
	-	digest of the value found in the previous step is calculated by using SHA-256 algorithm.;
	-	the digest value found in the previous step and the digest algorithm that was used are transformed as defined by the following ASN.1 structure:
	\code{.cpp}
			TBSDocumentDigest ::= SEQUENCE {
				algorithm AlgorithmIdentifier,
				digest OCTET STRING
			}
	\endcode
	-	the ASN.1 block value produced in the previous step is included in the OCSP request’s "nonce" field and must be present in the respective field of the OCSP response.
5.	In case of signing with ECC keys (by using ECDSA algorithm), concatenation method is used for creating signature value.
6.	In case of BDOC 2.1 documents, SHA-256 hash function is used by default when calculating data file digests and the digest that is signed. In case of Estonian ID cards with certificates issued before 2011, the SHA-224 digest type will be automatically selected and used for calculating signature value’s digest (the final digest that is signed), other options are not supported here. Note that other digest in the signature (e.g. data file digests, signer certificate’s digest) are still calculated with SHA-256 (the default digest type). 
7.	When a hash function that is weaker than SHA-256 (or SHA-224 in the special case with pre-2011 ID-cards) has been used then a warning message about weak digest method is produced to the user. It is recommended to regard the error as a validation warning (identically to DigiDoc3. Client application and digidoc-tool.cpp utility program). 
8.	During signature creation, it is checked that there is only one &lt;ClaimedRole&gt; element in the signature, which contains the signer’s role and optionally the signer’s resolution. If the &lt;ClaimedRole&gt; element contains both role and resolution then they must be separated with a slash mark, e.g. "role / resolution". Note that when setting the resolution value then role must also be specified. 
9.	The signature policy document’s hash value in &lt;SigPolicyHash&gt; element is checked during validation process (even though it is not mandatory according to BDOC 2.1 specification \ref BDOC "BDOC2.1:2013", chap. 5.2). The hash value must correspond to the hash value of the document that is located at https://www.sk.ee/repository/bdoc-spec20.pdf.
10.	&lt;Transforms&gt; element is allowed in the signature since v3.10 of the library for interoperability purposes. The transformation algorithms are not applied during signature validation.
11.	XML namespace prefixes are used in case of all XML elements (e.g. "asic:", "ds:", "xades:"). 
12.	The data file’s MIME type that is used in case of Libdigidocpp’s utility program is always "application/octet-stream" for testing purposes.
13.	The <ds:Signature> element’s Id attribute value is set to "S<seq_no>" during signature creation where sequence numbers are counted from zero. Other Id values that are used in the sub-elements of the <ds:Signature> element contain the signature’s Id value as a prefix. During verification, different Id attribute values are also supported but are not tested periodically.
14. signatures*.xml file's XML structure validation is done on the basis of XAdES XML Schema (\ref XAdES), however, there are additional checks to determine any unsupported elements that are allowed by the XAdES specification but are not allowed by the BDOC 2.1 specification (\ref BDOC). The unsupported elements are CounterSignature, CompleteCertificateRefs, CompleteRevocationRefs, AttributeCertificateRefs, AttributeRevocationRefs, SigAndRefsTimeStamp, RefsOnlyTimeStamp, AttrAuthoritiesCertValues, AttributeRevocationValues, CommitmentTypeIndicationType, AllDataObjectsTimeStamp, IndividualDataObjectsTimeStampType. 
15. Special characters in URI attribute values are handled according to RFC3986 (since v3.9 of the library): the characters are percent-encoded, except of unreserved characters and delimiters. Both percent-encoded and non-percent-encoded characters are supported during signature's validation. Note that as a result, the files that contain special characters in URI values and have been created with v3.9 might not be compatible with v3.8 of the library.
16. When validating a BDOC-TS document then the difference between OCSP validity confirmation's production time (producedAt field) and time-stamp's production time (getTime field) is checked. An exception is thrown if the OCSP confirmation's time is earlier than time-stamp's time. If the OCSP confirmation's time is later than time-stamp's time by more than 15 minutes then a warning is returned. If the difference is more than 24 hours then exception is thrown. 
17. During BDOC signature creation, it is checked that the difference between the signer's computer time and the OCSP response's production time (producedAt value) would not exceed 15 minutes. If the difference exceeds 15 minutes then an exception is returned and signing is cancelled.
18. In case of BDOC-TS signature, the time-stamping authority's (TSA's) certificate is not added to the &lt;CertificateValues&gt; element (differently from the requirements of \ref BDOC specification, chap 6) to avoid duplication of the certificate in the signature. It is expected that the TSA certificate is present in the time-stamp token itself.

\subsection cert-notes Certificate related notes
1.	Valid signatures (qualified electronic signatures) can be created with a certificate that has "Non-repudiation" value (also referred to as "Content Commitment") in its "Key usage" field. The requirement is based on the following sources:
	-	\ref nat-cert "ETSI TS 102 280 (V1.1.1)": "X.509 V3 Certificate Profile for Certificates Issued to Natural Persons"; chap. 5.4.3;
	-	Profile of certificates issued to private persons by AS Sertifitseerimiskeskus: "Certificates on identity card of Republic of Estonia", version 3.3; appendix A.3.3 (see \ref sknatcert "ESTEID profile");
	-	Profile of certificates issued to legal entities by AS Sertifitseerimiskeskus: "Profile of institution certificates and Certificate Revocation Lists", version 1.3; chap. 3.2.2 (see \ref skinstcert "Institution certificate profile").
2.	Signature can be created with a certificate that doesn’t have "Non-repudiation" value in its "Key-Usage" field when specific parameters have been set but validation of such signature will produce a respective error message and the signature is not considered as a qualified electronic signature.
3.	During signature validation, it is checked that the validity periods of the signer’s certificate and all the certificates in its CA chain include the signature creation time (value of the producedAt field in OCSP response).
	
\subsection container-notes Container related notes
1.	BDOC 2.1 files are created with .bdoc file extension. Extensions .asice and .sce are supported and recognized only when reading in an existing BDOC 2.1 file which has the respective extension value.
2.	Signatures are stored in META-INF/signatures*.xml files where ‘*’ is a sequence number, counting is started from zero. 
3.	There can be only one signature in one signatures*.xml file due to BDOC format’s legacy issues. Multiple signatures in one signatures*.xml file is not supported in order to maintain testing efficiency. The <ds:Signature> element’s Id attribute values in different signatures*.xml files are generated in the form of "S<seq_no>", the sequence numbers are always unique within one BDOC container.
4.	It is not allowed to add two data files with the same name to the container as the signed data file must be uniquely identifiable in the container.
5.	All data files in the container must be signed. All signatures in the container must sign all of the data files.
6.	The META-INF/manifest.xml file’s version attribute value is "1.0" (instead of "1.2") as the results of ASiC plug-tests event shows that version 1.0 is used only. The requirement of the OpenDocument version attribute value comes from \ref OpenDocument "OpenDocument standard" which is referred to in \ref ASiC "ASiC standard".
7.	Relative file paths are used, for example "META-INF/signatures*.xml" and "document.txt" instead of "/META-INF/signatures*.xml" and "/document.txt" to ensure better interoperability with third party applications when validating signatures.
8.	The ZIP container’s comment field contains version number of the library that was used for creating the file. The value can be useful, for example, when trying to determine the origin of an erroneous file. 
9.	"mimetype" file is not compressed in the BDOC 2.1 file’s ZIP container as the results of ASiC plug-tests event shows that this solution is most widely used.
10.	When a data file is added to the container then the modification time of the file (as it is registered in the file system) is preserved also in the ZIP container file. There is an exception if the file is added by reading it from an input stream - in that case, the current timestamp value is registered as "last modified" time in the ZIP file.
